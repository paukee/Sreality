# SReality.cz Price tracking and notification
Requests, store and send daily e-mail updates from properties at sreality.cz. Tracking price change. Also using google API for commute calculation.

This is not an official API. I am not affiliated with Sreality.cz in any way, and am not responsible for any damage that could be done with it.


Scheduled email result:

1. Permissions for queue are not in CDK, needs to be set up manually after deployment
2. Sreality has its own commute callcualtion -> problem with oauth
